Reviews and ratings given by the users for the products play a vital role in purchase decisions. Whenever we want to buy a particular product from any e-commerce website.We generally check the reviews of that product, and if people are giving positive responses or higher ratings, then the product is considered good to buy, and if there are more negative responses or lower ratings, then it is not considered a good buy. Recommendation systems work on automating the process of scanning through the reviews and then recommending products to other users based on the previously existing reviews and ratings. 
In general Recommendation System can be broadly classified into 
  ### User Based Recommendation System: 
It finds similar users and gives them recommendations based on what other people with similar consumption patterns appreciated.
  ### Item Based Recommendation System
 It finds similarity patterns between items and recommends them to users 
 
 In this project we have <br> 
1. Performed a sentiment analysis of user reviews on multiple products to extract the polarity of reviews and classify them as positive or negative.
2. TF-IDF vectorization has been used for feature extraction after removal of stop words and lemmatization using WordNet
3. Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost Models were built and performances evaluated based on F1 score
4. Created an item-item based product recommendation system on the ratings given by users
5. Improved the recommendation system using the sentiment classification of user reviews such that it would give 5 best products based on the sentiments of 20 recommended product reviews
6. Created a web application for the recommendation system using Flask framework
7. Deploy the web application using Heroku
